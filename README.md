# Project Euler Solutions

These are my solutions to Project Euler written in C. C was chosen to get some practice with a lower level language along with using some CLI tools like GCC and GDB.

## Index of Solutions

This is just a list of when I use a certain technique or algorithm. I won't list everything, just things that *may* be helpful later.

### Primes
- [Finding the Largest Prime Factor of a Number](./3.c)
  - Used trial division here to compute primes. There are other algorithms that are more effiencient
- [Finding the 10001st Prime Number](./7.c)
  - Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm for creating a list of the first n primes
